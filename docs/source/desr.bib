@article{Mijajlovi,
abstract = {The aim of this article is to exhibit a method for proving that certain analytic functions are not solutions of algebraic differential equations. The method is based on model-theoretic properties of differential fields and prop-erties of certain known transcendental differential functions, as of $\Gamma$(x). Fur-thermore, it also determines differential transcendence of solution of some functional equations. 1 Notation and preliminaries The theory DF 0 of differential fields of characteristic 0 is the theory of fields with additional two axioms that relate to the derivative D: D(x + y) = Dx + Dy, D(xy) = xDy + yDx. Thus, a model of DF 0 is a differential field K = (K, +, {\textperiodcentered}, D, 0, 1) where (K, +, {\textperiodcentered}, 0, 1) is a field and D is a differential operator satisfying the above axioms. A. Robinson proved that DF 0 has a model completion, and then defined DCF 0 to be the model completion of DF 0 . Subsequently, L. Blum found simple axioms of DFC 0 without refereeing to differential polynomials in more than one variable, see [22].},

Applications include a new approach to the construction and classification of differential invariants and invariant differential operators on jet bundles, as well as equivalence, symmetry, and rigidity theorems for submanifolds under general transformation groups. The method also leads to complete classifications of generating systems of differential invariants, explicit commutation formulae for the associated invariant differential operators, and a general clas-sification theorem for syzygies of the higher order differentiated differential invariants. A variety of illustrative examples demonstrate how the method can be directly applied to practical problems arising in geometry, invariant theory, and differential equations.

Such a situation arises, for instance, when we consider a system of equations on the differential invariants of a Lie group action. We develop the algebraic foundations for such a situation.

@inproceedings{Sit2005,
abstract = {Under both Ritt and Kolchin, basic differential algebra was developed from a constructive view point and the foundation they built has been advanced and extended to become applicable in symbolic computation. In the first talk, we begin with a study of the division algorithm and how it may be modified and used to perform reductions in polynomial rings, ordinary and then partial differential polynomial rings. The abstract notions of (partial) differential rings, fields, and differential polynomials will be covered and no prerequisite is necessary. We will use examples to illustrate how differential polynomials may be ordered and manipulated algebraically using Euclidean-like division. The goal is to apply the reduction algorithms for ideal membership decisions, when possible, and to ”simplify” a given system of algebraic differential equations like reducing the order, degree, and number of unknowns, or breaking the system up into ”simpler” systems. We will compare this with the analogous operations on algebraic systems. More formally, we will cover the concepts of term-ordering and ranking, partial reduction and reduction, autoreduced sets, Grobner basis and characteristic sets. In the second talk, we will discuss methods to compute Grobner basis and characteristic sets and the role they play in computational differential algebra: Are there constructive methods, though not necessarily efficient, to solve basic decidability problems? Each algebraic problem has a differential version simply by adding the word ”differential” to appropriate places. The ideal membership problem, “Can we tell if a given (differential) polynomial ideal contains a given (differential) polynomial?” will be revisited. Other questions to be discussed are: Can we tell if a given (differential) polynomial ideal is prime? or radical? Does a (differential) polynomial ideal have a finite basis? How do the algebraic and differential analogs differ? Both this talk and the October 28 talk will be informal and aimed at beginning graduate students. More rigorous treatment is available from my tutorial paper.},

abstract = {We construct sections of a structure presheaf of rational functions on a differential spectrum using only localization and projective limits. For this purpose we introduce a special form of a multiplicative system generated by one differential polynomial and call it D-localization. This technique allows us to obtain sections of a differential spectrum of a differential ring R with-out computation of diffspec R. We compare our construction with Kovacic's structure sheaf and with the results obtained by Keigher in [8] and discuss computational aspects. We prove that if R is a factorial differential ring then our construction gives the same answer as Kovacic's one. Moreover, if R is an RAAD ring then applying sheafification to our preasheaf one gets Kovacic's structure sheaf.},

abstract = {In this note we will discuss the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain from the point of view of matrices. We will then give a matrix-theoretic proof of the structure theorem from the point of view of the Smith normal form of a matrix over a principal ideal domain. One benefit from this method is that there are algorithms for finding the Smith normal form of a matrix, and these are programmed into common computer algebra packages such as Maple and MuPAD. These packages will make it easy to decompose a finitely generated module over a polynomial ring F [x] into a direct sum of cyclic submodules. To start, we will need to discuss describing a module by generators and relations. To motivate the definition, let F be a field, and take A ∈ M n (F). We can make F n , viewed as the set of column matrices over F , into an F [x]-module by defining f (x)v = f (A)v. This module structure is dependent on A; we denote this module by (F n) A . Write A = (a ij). If {\{}e 1 , . . . , e n {\}} is the standard basis of F n , then xe j = Ae j = [ n i=1 a ij e i for each j. Consequently, (x − a 11)e 1 − a 21 e 2 − {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} − a n1 e n = 0, −a 12 e 1 + (x − a 22)e 2 − {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} − a n2 e n = 0, . . . −a 1n e 1 − {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} + (x − a nn)e n = 0. The {\{}e i {\}} are generators of (F n) A as an F [x]-module, and these equations give relations between the generators. Moreover, as we will prove later, the module (F n) A is determined by the generators e 1 , . . . , e n and the relations given above. 1 Generators and Relations Let R be a principal ideal domain and let M be a finitely generated R-module. If {\{}m 1 , . . . , m n {\}} is a set of generators of M , then we have a surjective R-module homomorphism ϕ : R n → M given by sending (r 1 , . . . , r n) to n i=1 r i m i . Let K be the kernel of ϕ. Then M ∼ = R n /K, a fact we will use repeatedly. If (r 1 , . . . , r n) ∈ K, then n i=1 r i m i = 0. Thus, an element 1},

abstract = {Over-determined systems of partial differential equations may be stud-ied using differential–elimination algorithms, as a great deal of information about the solution set of the system may be obtained from the output. Unfortunately, many systems are effectively intractable by these methods due to the expression swell incurred in the intermediate stages of the calculations. This can happen when, for example, the input system depends on many variables and is invariant under a large rotation group, so that there is no natural choice of term ordering in the elimination and reduction processes. This paper describes how systems written in terms of the differential invariants of a Lie group action may be processed in a manner analo-gous to differential–elimination algorithms. The algorithm described terminates and yields, in a sense which we make precise, a complete set of representative invariant integrability conditions which may be calculated in a " critical pair " completion pro-cedure. Further, we discuss some of the profound differences between algebras of differential invariants and standard differential algebras. We use the new, regularized moving frame method of Fels and Olver [11], [12] to write a differential system in terms of the invariants of a symmetry group. The methods described have been implemented as a package in MAPLE. The main example discussed is the analysis of the (2 + 1)-d'Alembert–Hamilton system u xx + u yy − u zz = f (u), u 2 x + u 2 y − u 2 z = 1. (1) We demonstrate the classification of solutions due to Collins [7] for f = 0 using the new methods.},

abstract = {Michaelis and Menten introduced to biochemistry the idea of time-scale separation, in which part of a system is assumed to be operating sufficiently fast compared to the rest so that it may be taken to have reached a steady state. This allows, in principle, the fast components to be eliminated, resulting in a simplified description of the system's behaviour. Similar ideas have been widely used in different areas of biology, including enzyme kinetics, protein allostery, receptor pharmacology, gene regulation and post-translational modification. However, the methods used have been independent and ad hoc. In the present study, we review the use of time-scale separation as a means to simplify the description of molecular complexity and discuss recent work setting out a single framework that unifies these separate calculations. The framework offers new capabilities for mathematical analysis and helps to do justice to Michaelis and Menten's insights about individual enzymes in the context of multi-enzyme biological systems.},

Nevertheless, except for linear ODE models, the question of establishing identifiable combinations of parameters when the model is unidentifiable has not received as much attention and the problem is not fully resolved for nonlinear ODEs. Identifiable combinations are useful, for example, for the reparam-eterization of an unidentifiable ODE model into an identifiable one. We extend an existing algorithm for finding globally identifiable parameters of nonlinear ODE models to generate the 'simplest' globally iden-tifiable parameter combinations using Gr{\"{o}}bner Bases.

@article{Havas1998,
abstract = {Extended gcd calculation has a long history and plays an important role in computational number theory and linear algebra. Recentresults have shown that finding optimal multipliers in extended gcd calculations is difficult. We present an algorithm which uses lattice basis reduction to produce small integer multipliers X1, {\ldots}, Xm for the equation s = gcd (S1, {\ldots}, sm) = X1S1 + {\ldots} + XmSm, where S1, {\ldots}, Sm are given integers. The method generalises to produce small unimodular transformation matrices for computing the Hermite normal form of an integer matrix.},
